# Slack Notification Guidelines

## Notification Triggers
- Send a Slack notification to the #latin-acadmey channel for every project update, commit, or pull request.
- Use @channel or @here to ensure all members are notified for important updates.

## Notification Content
- Include clear, meaningful descriptions of the update, commit, or PR.
- Provide links to the relevant commit, PR, or resource when possible.
- Use concise, human-readable language.

## Notification Timing
- Send notifications immediately after the event occurs.

## Clean Communication
- Avoid unnecessary or duplicate notifications.
- Group related updates into a single notification when appropriate.
- Use consistent formatting for all messages.

## Respect Channel Purpose
- Only send project-related updates to #latin-acadmey.
- Avoid off-topic or personal messages in the notification flow.
